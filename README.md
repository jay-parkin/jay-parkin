# About

As a detail-oriented and highly organised software developer, I bring
extensive expertise in full-stack development, software design, and problem-solving
to the table. My strong programming skills encompass a range of
languages including Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript.
I have a proven track record in web application development, leveraging
HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React and Angular. My proficiency extends to
database management, covering all aspects from design to optimisation, with
a solid grasp of SQL.

## Work History

### IT Support @ Jb Metropolitan Distributors, 2013 - Present

I provide technical support to over 100 employees across four remote
locations. I diagnose hardware and network problems using advanced
troubleshooting techniques. My goal is to enhance software security to
protect against vulnerabilities, ensuring data integrity. Additionally, I
configure hardware and authorise system access for new staff members. I also
guide customers in issue identification and explain solutions to restore
service. If I discover potential sales opportunities, I promptly report them
to my supervisor. I respond quickly to sales leads and technical support
requests as part of my responsibilities.

Key accomplishments:
● Spearheaded special projects, including Java-based staff QR Bundy
system and visitor log system, and a JavaScript chatbot utilising Google's
API for real-time data feed to users.
● Designed and implemented employee system operational in two
distinct locations.
● Engineered visitor system for emergency scenarios.
● Automated numerous repetitive tasks, significantly enhancing
workforce productivity by reclaiming valuable hours.
